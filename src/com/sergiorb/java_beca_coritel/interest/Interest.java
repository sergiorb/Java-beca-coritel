*
*	Letâ€™s use the for statement to compute compound interest. Consider the following problem:
*	A person invests $1,000 in a savings account yielding 5% interest. Assuming that all the 
*	interest is left on deposit, calculate and print the amount of money in the account at the 
*	end of each year for 10 years. Use the following formula to determine the amounts:
*	a = p (1 + r)^n
*
*	where:
*
*	p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal)
*	r is the annual interest rate (e.g., use 0.05 for 5%)
*	n is the number of years
*	a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year.
*	
*	The solution to this problem involves a loop that performs the indicated calculation 
*	for each of the 10 years the money remains on deposit.
